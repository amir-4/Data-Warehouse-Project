## 🔹 Data Warehouse Layers

### 🥉 Bronze Layer  
Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database.

### 🥈 Silver Layer  
This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

### 🏅 Gold Layer  
Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements  

### **Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**  
**Objective**  
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.  

**Specifications**  
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as `.csv` files.  
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.  
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.  
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.  
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.  


  These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
